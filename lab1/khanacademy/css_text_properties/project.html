    <h2 id="morning">Morning Routine</h2>
    <p class="date">Monday, 8:00 AM</p>
    <p>
        I woke up before my human, as always. I walked on their face to make
        sure they were alive. Then I asked for food. After eating, I stared
        out the window and judged birds.
    </p>

        I slept for four hours straight. When I woke up, I knocked a pen off
        the table. I don’t know why — it just felt right. Then I cleaned myself
        very seriously.
    </p>

    <h2 id="night">Night Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="date">Monday, 11:47 PM</p>
    <p>
        My human tried to sleep, but I decided it was playtime. I ran across
        the room at full speed for no reason. Now I am tired again. Good night.
